# What is [gitsheet](https://github.com/ArasGitHub/gitsheet/blob/master/gitsheet.md)?

This repo contains my [notes](https://github.com/ArasGitHub/gitsheet/blob/master/gitsheet.md) on git which I have collected over the time I have been using (g)it! There are plenty of great resources online includining the official [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

This is by no means a complete guide; however I have found it usefull when bringing newbies up to speed. I refer back to this help file myself to refresh my mind on commands. Also this has served as a minimal sufficient set for me to get most of my day job done in git.

The assumption is that you have git installed and have a working terminal.
